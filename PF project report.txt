                                         INTRODUCTION  

Hospital management system is a system in which admin can add patient’s  
records, also he/she can make changes in it like search for a record or edit a  
record or see the list of records and delete the records of the patients who are  
discharged.  

  

  

                                          BACKGROUND  

This project is based on a console application developed on C language in which  
we have done filing for managing records of patients. We have covered almost all  
the topics taught to us i.e. structures, filing, pointers, conditional statements,  
function recursion and many more.  

  

                                  PROJECT SPECIFICATION  

First user will be asked:  

    1.  Sign Up:  
                        Here user will sign up if he doesn’t want to login with the default  
         username and password of the management system.  
          
    2.  Log in:  
                     If user selects log in then he will be asked to enter the default  
         username and password. He will be given three chances to enter correct  
         username and password if he enters wrong username or password more  
        than three times the program will be ended.  
          
        After logging in to the management system, a choice screen is displayed  
        giving user 6 choices.  
                Add Record.  
                Edit record.  
                List record.  

----------------------- Page 3-----------------------

                 Delete record.  
                 Search record.  
                 Exit.  

                                            PROBLEM ANALYSIS  

We have gone through many hospital management systems and found that the  
major issues in the management systems were as follows:  

        Security issues:  
                                     We have created a login and signup page for the user so  
         that he/she can register his/her hospital and clinic first. The password given  
         by user on sign up page will be encrypted  and saved in the file so that no  
         one will be able to see the password.   
        Searching for the record:  
                                                       In many management systems, we have seen that  
         there was no search function so if the user want to search one record out  
         of thousands much time was taken. We have created a search a function in  
         which a user is asked for first name of patient and the fuction will fetch the  
         whole record of patient.  
             
        Editing the record:  
                                          There was no editing function in management systems so  
         we have added a function in our program, which will ask user the first name  
         of patient, and then he will be able to update/renew the specific record.

           SOLUTION DESIGN (Project Details, Functionality &  
                                         Methodology)  

                                         Project Details  

    The project is a hospital management system in which the admin will first sign  
    up. Once he have registered himself he can now log in to the system directly,  
    where he can add  patients record, view the records, delete the records, edit  
    the records, and search for the specific record.    

                                                                                                          

                                          Functionality  

In the add function the admin will be asked to enter first name of patient, his last  
name, age, address, gender, email id, prescribed doctor, and the problem faced  
by patient.  

In edit function, the admin can update the specific record by giving the first name  
of the patient, which he want to edit.  

----------------------- Page 5-----------------------

In delete function, the admin will be asked for the first name of the patient whose  
record he wants to delete.  

In list function, the admin will be able to see the records of patient.  

In search function, the admin will be able to search the specific record of patient.  

   

                                        Methodology  

Libraries:  

#include <stdio.h>  

#include <conio.h>  

#include <string.h>  

#include <stdlib.h>  

#include <windows.h>  

Structures:  

There are two structures in our program namely patient and account. The  
structure of patient contains name, age, address, email, prescribed doctor,  
problem in their respective data type. While account structure contain username  
and password in string data type.  

 Functions:  

       void title():  
        It contains the heading which is shown on all pages  
       void welcomescreen():  
        It contains the welcome screen.  
       void signup():  
        It contains sign up page in which admin can register himself  
       void loginscreen():  
        It contains the login system of management.  
       void choice():  
        It contains the page which asks the user what task he want to perform.  

----------------------- Page 6-----------------------

   void add():  
     It takes the details of patients.  
   void edit():  
     It shows the page on which we can edit the specific record.  
   void del():  
     It shows the page on which we can delete the specific record.  
   void view():  
    This function gives all the records of patients.  
   void search():  
     It shows the page on where we can search the specific record.  
   void exitme();  
     It exits the management system.  
      
      

                                       IMPLEMENTATION  

The designed system implementation was done to replace a manual system  
with the computerized one. The objective was to put the tested system in to  
operation. Critical aspects of conversion are not disrupting the functioning of  
the organization. This phase gives us the clears pictures of our new system and  
all the points that have been carefully looked in when designing the  
computerized system.  

Sincere efforts were taken for the implementation of the following goals.  

    Maximizing the output reliability  
    Maximizing the source test readability  
    Minimizing the development time
